## üöÄ Project Overview

### Motivation
Brain tumor detection and classification is one of the most challenging areas in medical imaging. Traditional methods often suffer from:
- **Time-consuming processes**
- **Subjectivity** in diagnosis
- **Human errors**

This project leverages **Deep Learning** techniques to provide a solution that automates the classification of brain tumors from MRI scans. The goal is to enhance diagnostic efficiency and accuracy.

### Scientific Significance
Using state-of-the-art **Deep Learning** models, this project aims to:
- **Automate medical image analysis**
- **Classify tumor types** with high precision
- **Improve diagnostic speed** and reduce human intervention

## üß¨ Medical Imaging & Deep Learning

### Key Technologies
- **Framework**: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) - A leading framework for deep learning.
- **Model Architecture**: **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** - A powerful architecture for image analysis.
- **Image Type**: **MRI Scans** - A common imaging modality for brain tumor detection.

### Research Objectives
1. **Develop an automated system** for brain tumor detection using CNN.
2. **Achieve high accuracy** in classifying multiple tumor types (e.g., glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor).
3. **Reduce diagnostic time** and provide support for clinicians.

## üî¨ Methodology

### Data Processing Workflow
1. **Data Exploration**: Conducting in-depth analysis to understand data patterns, missing values, and distribution.
2. **Image Augmentation**: Applying transformations like rotations, flips, and zoom to increase dataset diversity and improve generalization.
3. **Model Training**: Training the CNN using a supervised learning approach on labeled MRI data.
4. **Multi-Class Classification**: The model classifies MRI scans into different categories based on tumor types.

img = Image.open("path_to_image.jpg")
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
])
img_tensor = transform(img).unsqueeze(0)

# Predict the tumor type
output = model(img_tensor)
prediction = torch.argmax(output, dim=1)
print(f"Predicted tumor type: {prediction.item()}")
```
